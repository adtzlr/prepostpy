Documentation of PrePostPy
==========================

**PrePostPy** provides a high-level scripting interface for **Pre**- and **Post**-processing of input and post files of MSC.Marc Mentat® written in **Py**-thon. It is **NOT** meant as a feature-complete replacement of the original modules *py_mentat* and *py_post*, but rather as a high-level extension built on top of *py_mentat* and *py_post*.
